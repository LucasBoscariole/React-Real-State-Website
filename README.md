# React Real Estate Website

Website made from scratch with React. The website form works with Firebase backend that goes to my account.
The website has animations, icons, carousel and styled components.

The website speed to be seen is before Firebase, because this website is for skill practicing, that's why I left firebase as the form submition. It would be of better us to handle submit with something else.

Speed before Firebase:
-Mobile Speed Website: 93
-Desktop Speed Website: 98

Speed after Firebase:
-Mobile Speed Website: 77
-Desktop Speed Website: 97
